dotfiles
========

A template for dot files meant for a Coder environment.

This will use the `install.sh` script to [personalize the environment](https://enterprise.coder.com/docs/dotfiles-2#customizing-the-installation-process).

| Dir | Purpose |
| --- | ------- |
| `home` | dotfiles that will be symlinked to your home directory |
